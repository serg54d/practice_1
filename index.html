The acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to these Terms and Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by the Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied.

								Change of Ownership
							</h3>
							<p class="task3paragraphcontent">
								Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and the representations made by the Customer. In the event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether total or partial, the Customer must immediately provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of these changes. Until Shop receives written notice from the Customer of a change in ownership, the Customer (including where it is a company or trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds Shop indemnified against any and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs, charges, fees and expenses incurred or suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company (including the same company but with a different shareholder or shareholders) or other entity (including a trust) which may have purchased the Customer's business or any interest in the Customer's business or any of the shares in the Customer and used the Customer's previously approved account for trading.

The Customer agrees to accept delivery of the Products sold at any time during normal business hours.
							</p>
							<p class="task3paragraphcontent">
